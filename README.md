# NeuroEvolution "Moving Cars" with TensorFlow.js

Combining neural networks and a genetic algorithms, we can train an agent to **"drive" in a pseudo-random enviroment**. Check out the [live example](https://rapsssito.github.io/neuroevolution-cars/).

Heavily inspired by [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/)'s [Neuroevolution Flappy Bird](https://github.com/CodingTrain/website/tree/master/Courses/natureofcode/11.3_neuroevolution_tfjs.js).
